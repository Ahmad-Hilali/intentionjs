title: How To Create Custom Axes
sub: Documentation Extended to Include Custom Axis Creation &amp; Initialization

Good news, everyone! We recently added a bunch of stuff to the documentation that covers [custom axis creation](/index.html#t5). In it, every property of an `intent.responsive({...})` axis is explained. There's also some helpful tips for avoiding common mistakes and best practices to achieve what you want.

We also added some [information on initializing](/index.html#t6) intention.js. This is vital information if you are not using context.js. Context takes care of a lot of the initialization, but some legwork is needed when going solo. And we encourage you to do so!

Should you need any additional explanation or help, feel free to [email us](mailto:joe.kendall@dowjones.com) or talk to us [on Twitter (@intentionjs)](https://twitter.com/intentionjs).

Good luck!
